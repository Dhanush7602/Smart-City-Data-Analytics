## Project Overview

The Smart City Data Analytics Platform combines multiple datasets from urban environments to provide insights that are crucial for city planners, environmental analysts, and public safety officials. By offering accessible, data-driven visualizations, this tool aids in understanding the interplay between air quality, ICT infrastructure, crime data, and traffic congestion across urban areas.

## Features

- Air Quality Analysis: Presents trends in pollutant levels like PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2 to evaluate environmental health.
- ICT Infrastructure: Assesses technology coverage (e.g., internet access) and adoption of smart devices across cities.
- Crime Data Analysis: Tracks crime types and trends over time, analyzing occurrences by demographic factors.
- Traffic Data Analysis: Examines traffic congestion levels specific to Bangalore, with comparisons across different times and areas.
- Correlation Heatmaps: Displays inter-relationships between urban metrics, allowing for multifactorial analysis.
- User-Friendly Interface: Interactive web app built with embedded CSS and Plotly visualizations.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python: Primary programming language for data processing and backend.
- Flask: Web framework to build the platform and manage the routing and server operations.
- Pandas: Used for data preprocessing, cleaning, and manipulation.
- Plotly: Provides interactive, web-friendly charts and heatmaps for data visualization.
- HTML & CSS: Custom styling and structuring of web templates.
  
## Data Sources

- Air Quality Data: Contains information on various pollutants across cities.
- Crime Data: Provides data on crime types and occurrences by demographics.
- ICT Infrastructure Data: Insights into internet access and smart device adoption across cities.
- Traffic Data: Traffic patterns and congestion specific to Bangalore.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-city-data-analytics.git
   cd smart-city-data-analytics
   ```
   
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Homepage: Enter a city name to retrieve data.
2. Results Page: Displays detailed analyses for air quality, crime data, ICT infrastructure, and traffic (for Bangalore).
3. Visualizations: Interactive charts and heatmaps allow users to dive into specific metrics and relationships.

## Project Structure

- app.py: Main application file containing Flask app routes and backend logic.
- templates: Contains HTML files with embedded CSS for styling.
- static: Directory for static assets (if any).
- data: Folder containing sample datasets for air quality, crime, ICT, and traffic.

## Future Enhancements

- Real-Time Data Integration: Incorporate live data for more up-to-date insights.
- User Authentication: Allow users to save their analysis preferences and download reports.
- Advanced Predictive Analytics: Add predictive models to forecast traffic or pollution levels.

By consolidating multiple urban datasets into a single, easy-to-use platform, this project provides stakeholders with insights for informed decisions in urban development and sustainability.
